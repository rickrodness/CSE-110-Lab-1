# Welcome to my Github User Page

My name is **Rick Rodness**, I am a 3rd year Computer Science major at **UC San Diego**, my passion lies in **machine learning** and **software development**. I thrive on the challenge of solving complex problems and transforming them into elegant software solutions. Throughout my academic journey, I have delved deep into languages such as **Java**, **Python**, and **C/C++**, equipping myself with a versatile toolkit for creating innovative software.

## My Academic and Research Interests

Currently, as an undergraduate researcher, my focus is on **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)** and **Gaussian Splatting** for advanced view synthesis. My focus is on implementing these popular differentiable rendering algorithms using **Slang**. Slang is a new GPU programming language developed by NVIDIA that supports automatic differentiation and a user-friendly interface, we are testing it on these algorithms to see if we can make them more efficient and accessible.

```python
# Example of a simple Python code snippet
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to my GitHub page.")
```

What truly excites me is the opportunity to apply my skills in a professional software engineering role. I am particularly interested in positions that involve **algorithm design**, **data-intensive applications**, or the development of **user-friendly interfaces**. My goal is to contribute to software projects that not only present technical challenges but also make a meaningful impact.
