# Welcome to my Github User Page

My name is **Rick Rodness**, I am a 3rd year Computer Science major at **UC San Diego**, my passion lies in **machine learning** and **software development**. I thrive on the challenge of solving complex problems and transforming them into elegant software solutions. Throughout my academic journey, I have delved deep into languages such as **Java**, **Python**, and **C/C++**, equipping myself with a versatile toolkit for creating innovative software.

## My Academic and Research Interests

Currently, as an undergraduate researcher, I am deeply involved with **Neural Radiance Fields** (NeRF) and **Gaussian Splatting** for advanced view synthesis. I am working on implementing these differentiable rendering algorithms using **Slang**, a new GPU programming language developed by NVIDIA. Slang is designed to support automatic differentiation and offers a user-friendly interface, making it an ideal tool for our research. Our goal is to test these algorithms with Slang to enhance their efficiency and accessibility.

```python
# Example of a simple Python code snippet
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to my GitHub page.")
```

What truly excites me is the opportunity to apply my skills in a professional software engineering role. I am particularly interested in positions that involve **algorithm design**, **data-intensive applications**, or the development of **user-friendly interfaces**. My goal is to contribute to software projects that not only present technical challenges but also make a meaningful impact.
